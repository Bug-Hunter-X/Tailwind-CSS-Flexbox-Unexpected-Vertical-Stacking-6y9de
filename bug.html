```html
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    This is red
  </div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    This is blue
  </div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to style two divs.  However, if you inspect it, the blue div might appear below the red div, not next to it in a row. This is because flex items stack vertically by default if they don't have enough horizontal space.
